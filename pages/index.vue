        I am an independent software developer and the creator of the open source
        JavaScript framework Vue.js. Most of my work is open source and publicly
        available on GitHub. You can follow me on Twitter where I mostly tweet
        about Vue and frontend technologies. If you happen to speak Chinese, my
        Chinese name is 尤雨溪 (yóu yǔ xī). You can also find me on 微博 and
        知乎. Outside of programming and helping my wife take care of our two
        kids, I enjoy video games, karaoke, sushi and collecting watches.
